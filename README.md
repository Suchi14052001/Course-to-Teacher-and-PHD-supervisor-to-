In any learning institution, allotting a teacher to course and supervisor to PHD student manually, it is a time consuming task. Instead, this is an attempt made

I have participated in Archetype Expo in University of Hyderabad presenting this topic and I received appalause from many industry experts and faculty. Here is the 
link to the video of me demonstrating the entire project
