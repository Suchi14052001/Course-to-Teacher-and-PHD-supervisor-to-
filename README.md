In any learning institution, allotting a teacher to course and supervisor to PHD student manually, it is a time consuming task. Instead, this is an attempt made 
by me to automate this process by showing recommendations of teachers to courses and PHD supervisors to PHD students

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, AJAX

I have participated in Archetype Expo in University of Hyderabad presenting this topic and I received appalause from many industry experts and faculty. Here is the
